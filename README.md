APOD: Astronomical Pic Of the Day
This is a Chrome Extension which shows the "Astronomical Picture Of the Day" by using a NASA Api with the help of basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript and shows a brief about it by fetching details from the Api and it refreshes everyday!!

Feedbacks are appriciated!

As this was my first project of my coding Journey!! Many more to come.
Happy Coding
