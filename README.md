APOD

APOD: Astronomical Pic Of the Day This is a Chrome Extension that shows the "Astronomical Picture Of the Day" by using a NASA API with the help of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and shows a brief about it by fetching details from the API and it refreshes every day!!

Feedbacks are appreciated!

This was the first project of my coding Journey!! Many more to come. 

Happy Coding!
